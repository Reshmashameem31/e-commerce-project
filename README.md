# My E-Commerce Website

**My E-Commerce Website** is a fullstack online store built to showcase my web development skills.  
It uses **React + Vite** for the frontend, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **MongoDB Atlas** for the backend.  
The website provides a complete shopping experience including browsing products, viewing details, managing a shopping cart, and checkout (without real payment). User authentication is implemented using **JWT**, and authenticated users can view their order history.
